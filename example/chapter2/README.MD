# Programming Method 2 – Chapter 1

This project demonstrates engineering-oriented Python software
using a 1-DOF motor simulated in MuJoCo.

## Purpose
- Show difference between scripting and engineering software
- Introduce actuator abstraction
- Demonstrate clean software structure

## Run
```bash
python src/main.py
